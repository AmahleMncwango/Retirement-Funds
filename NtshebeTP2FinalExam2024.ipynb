        "South Africa’s retirement savings have recently undergone reform through the **Two-Pot Retirement System**. This system divides contributions into:  \n",
        "- **Accessible Pot:** allows limited withdrawals before retirement (short-term financial relief).  \n",
        "- **Locked Pot:** preserved until retirement age (long-term financial security).  \n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to apply **machine learning** to analyze financial and demographic data, with a focus on:  \n",
        "1. **Predicting withdrawals** from the accessible pot (classification).  \n",
        "2. **Forecasting growth** of the locked pot (time-series forecasting).  \n",
        "3. **Explaining how sentiment analysis** could be applied to employee feedback (conceptual only).  \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will strictly follow best practices and the exam requirements: working in Python 3, using Jupyter Notebook (Colab), sourcing open datasets, and documenting the full **data science lifecycle**.\n"
